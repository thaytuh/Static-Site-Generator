          I can't guarantee this consistency will keep up, but I'm trying my
          best for now. Today has been a bit slower but I think there's been
          some fun advancements I'd like to share.

        <h2>Todo: Todo</h2>
        <p>
          I attempted to make my own todo app using python and a sqlite
          database, but couldn't figure out SQLAlchemy, so I turned to a Youtube
          tutorial (I swear I won't get stuck in tutorial hell) and it went
          quite well. I went through the tutorial as normal, had to some
          troubleshooting on my own, and modified the HTML to look a bit better
          when I was done with the tutorial. I don't have any extra plans for it
          right now, because the last thing the software world needs is another
          todo app, but it was fun to make and helped me understand some
          concepts I was struggling with.

          All my life I've been a Windows user. I've dabbled in different Linux
          distros over the last few years, but never fully replaced Windows as
          my daily driver. Until today.
        </p>
        <p>I ordered a Macbook.</p>
        <p>
          More specifically, a refurbished M1 Macbook Pro with 32GB of RAM and a
          512GB SSD. I've been thinking about doing this for a while now, but
          never fully got around to it as I was scared to finally just make that
          leap. But after watching hours of videos and reading line after line
          of Reddit posts, I finally caved. My plan is to replace my current
          Windows laptop, that I've had for 4 years now, with the Macbook. I
          will still be using Windows on my work computer (obviously) and on my
          home PC, as I primarily use that for gaming, so it won't be a full
          replacement. I'm excited to learn a new OS and discover all the
          advantages and shortcomings that come with the territory of MacOS, but
          mainly I'm excited to have a nicer laptop. The laptop I have now isn't
          *bad* by any means, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely showing
          signs of use. The bottom case has a multiple of cracks, the rubber
          feet are peeling off and have now been stretched to the point where I
          can no longer just super glue them back on in the original way (the
          feet are more long bars of rubber that run along the bottom of the
          laptop. oh HP, the way you are), and the hardware just isn't up to the
          spec it used to be. Now, granted, the hardware was not really top of
          the line when I first got the computer, but it served its duty. I
          won't fully get rid of it, but I think it will primarily sit at home
          and act as a secondary gaming station if my girlfriend wants to play
          something with me that her laptop can't handle (my laptop is a gaming
          laptop, although it has a 3050 Ti laptop GPU, so it's not the shiniest
          gem in the shop). All in all, I'm excited for this new journey into
          the <b>Cult of Apple</b> and look forward to this new experience. The
          Macbook should get here maybe tomorrow or Friday, so I'll make sure to
          write about it as soon as I get my grubby little mitts on it.

          I think I'll end this one with another quote of the day, staying on
          brand with today's topic:
