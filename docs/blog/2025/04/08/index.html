        <h1>Day 1 - 2025-04-08</h1>
        <p>
          I've decided that, if I made a static site generator, why not use that
          to start up a blog? So, here's my attempt at doing just that.
        </p>
        <h3>word vomit</h3>
        <p>
          I'm not entirely sure how I want to structure this, or if I even want
          to structure it at all, but I also think maybe I just want to word
          vomit a bit to get the ball rolling. Maybe I'll make a proper title
          page with links to my blog posts? Or maybe I make the title page, then
          have like a <b>Contact Me</b> page or something like that and also a
          big directory page that links to all my day-to-day posts, as well as
          just fun stuff that I want to put in. I mean, I have the generator and
          it *should* work, right? I think I'll maybe also go in and change
          around the CSS, as I'm not in love with the default colors and font
          used in the project originally. I'm quite fond of the JetBrains Mono
          font and the color scheme used in the Catppuccin theme, more
          specifically the Mocha variant (this is the theme I use across both
          Obsidian and VS Code).
        </p>
        <h3>let's talk about projects</h3>
        <p>
          Well anyway, today I got thinking about starting up a small simple
          CRUD application, as I'll need to do a personal project for my
          Boot.dev course. I have an idea for the Capstone project (ooo scary)
          but I'm still a bit away from being able to fully commit to that as it
          involves some frontend (ew) stuff and database management and API
          calls and blah blah blah. I have a general framework set up for that
          project, but outside of installing dependencies and setting up the
          folder structure, I haven't done anything with it. I'm very excited
          with how it could turn out, but at the same time, very hesitant to
          start it as I'm starting the Golang modules in my course soon, and
          will focus pretty heavily on Go before the Capstone, so I might switch
          over to that and I'd rather not have to refactor my entire codebase if
          possible.
        </p>
        <h3>exciting starts</h3>
        <p>
          In other news, yesterday I had a meeting with the director at my
          company that oversees our dev team. Now granted, our dev team is quite
          small, as software is not my company's main throughput, but what they
          do is important! I spoke with her about potentially starting a
          mentorship program, or something similar, and she seemed pretty stoked
          about the idea. She mentioned that she had recently spoken to some
          higher-ups about getting more members on the team, so she said this
          couldn't have come at a better time. She showed me a bit of their
          DevOps process and generally what they're working on, as well as
          filling me in on what they plan to work on in the coming years or so.
          Overall, it was a really insightful meeting that gives me hope for the
          future, even if it doesn't end up playing out exactly how I want it
          to.
        </p>
        <p>But anyway, I'll finish this off with a quote of the day!</p>
