    <article><div><h1>About</h1><h2>About this blog</h2><p>This blog is about</p><ul><li>my experience as a self-taught, beginner software developer</li><li>showcasing my journey through personal and work projects</li><li>helping me put my thoughts down on paper (or pixels I guess?) and visualize those thoughts</li><li>anything else I feel like adding really</li></ul><h2>About me</h2><p>I'm an aspiring software developer. I live in Tempe, AZ. I prefer working with backend technologies and frameworks. I currently work full time as a Helpdesk Administrator.</p><p>I have one main thought about about programming, which is that it's fucking magic. No, really. If you think about it, programming, and technology as a whole, is the closest thing to fantasy-level magic we have available to us. Computer hardware is just made up of naturally occurring materials that we decided to compound and synthesize into other materials, and then draw symbols on them to make them *do things*. The issue was, once we saw that they could do things, we realized we needed to figure out how to tell them to do the things we want. That's where programming comes in. What is programming if not just speaking incantations into rocks carved with runes so the rocks act how we want them to? I think this is what drew me into computers when I was young, and still keeps me interested in learning more to this day.</p><p>Want to get in touch? <a href="/Static-Site-Generator/contact">Contact me here</a>.</p><p>This site was generated with a custom-built <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python">static site generator</a> from the course on <a href="https://www.boot.dev">Boot.dev</a>.</p></div></article>
