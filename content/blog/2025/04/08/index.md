# Day 1 - 2025-04-08

I've decided that, if I made a static site generator, why not use that to start up a blog? So, here's my attempt at doing just that.

### word vomit

I'm not entirely sure how I want to structure this, or if I even want to structure it at all, but I also think maybe I just want to word vomit a bit to get the ball rolling. Maybe I'll make a proper title page with links to my blog posts? Or maybe I make the title page, then have like a **Contact Me** page or something like that and also a big directory page that links to all my day-to-day posts, as well as just fun stuff that I want to put in. I mean, I have the generator and it *should* work, right? I think I'll maybe also go in and change around the CSS, as I'm not in love with the default colors and font used in the project originally. I'm quite fond of the JetBrains Mono font and the color scheme used in the Catppuccin theme, more specifically the Mocha variant (this is the theme I use across both Obsidian and VS Code).

### let's talk about projects

Well anyway, today I got thinking about starting up a small simple CRUD application, as I'll need to do a personal project for my Boot.dev course. I have an idea for the Capstone project (ooo scary) but I'm still a bit away from being able to fully commit to that as it involves some frontend (ew) stuff and database management and API calls and blah blah blah. I have a general framework set up for that project, but outside of installing dependencies and setting up the folder structure, I haven't done anything with it. I'm very excited with how it could turn out, but at the same time, very hesitant to start it as I'm starting the Golang modules in my course soon, and will focus pretty heavily on Go before the Capstone, so I might switch over to that and I'd rather not have to refactor my entire codebase if possible.

### exciting starts

In other news, yesterday I had a meeting with the director at my company that oversees our dev team. Now granted, our dev team is quite small, as software is not my company's main throughput, but what they do is important! I spoke with her about potentially starting a mentorship program, or something similar, and she seemed pretty stoked about the idea. She mentioned that she had recently spoken to some higher-ups about getting more members on the team, so she said this couldn't have come at a better time. She showed me a bit of their DevOps process and generally what they're working on, as well as filling me in on what they plan to work on in the coming years or so. Overall, it was a really insightful meeting that gives me hope for the future, even if it doesn't end up playing out exactly how I want it to.

But anyway, I'll finish this off with a quote of the day!
